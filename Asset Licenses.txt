'Preydator' Assets Licenses

Multiple assets were obtained from the Unity Asset Store and are used under a Standard Unity Assset Store EULA.
This EULA can be found here: https://unity3d.com/legal/as_terms
As defined within it, all assets used are 'Non-Restricted'.
This permits, as explained in Section 2, "END-USER's Rights and Obligations" that:
"Licensor grants to the END-USER a non-exclusive, worldwide, and perpetual license to the Asset to integrate it 
only as incorporated and embedded components of electronic applications and digital media and distribute such 
electronic application and digital media..."
Also: "Except for services software development kits (“Services SDKs”), END-USERS may modify Assets."
Other restrictions are specified. Ours is not an SDK, and we have not breached any of the other restrictions.
